# HandGame Arena 🎮  

HandGame Arena is a fast-paced multiplayer Rock-Paper-Scissors elimination game built for Reddit. Players can create private rooms, invite friends, or join public rooms to compete in real time. The last player standing wins!  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Private & Public Rooms** – Create a room, invite friends with a unique link, or join a public game.  
- **Real-Time Multiplayer** – Play with friends or challenge players worldwide.  
- **Fast-Paced Rounds** – Each round lasts a few seconds, and losing players are eliminated.  
- **Simple & Fun** – Luck and strategy decide the winner!  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React (Reddit’s WebView template)  
- **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript)  
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets *(Not supported on Reddit yet 😢)*  
- **Hosting:** Google Cloud Run  

## ⚠️ Important  
Reddit does not currently support WebSockets, so the game **won’t work on Reddit yet**. However, the project is ready for real-time play once WebSocket support is available!  

## 📺 Community  
Join the **[HandGame Arena Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/handchallenge/)** to discuss the game, share feedback, and stay updated!  

## 📌 Next Steps  
- If WebSockets become available in Devvit, I'll bring the game to Reddit.  
- Exploring alternative ways to enable real-time multiplayer on Reddit.
